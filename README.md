# YAGPDB scripts


My own collection of YAGPDB scripts, which I use on my Discord Server. Most of the scripts are disabled or not used anymore, I decided to open source them so other can benefit from it.

### Requirements
* [Discord](https://discord.com/)
* [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz/), make sure you [read the documents](https://docs.yagpdb.xyz/commands/all-commands)
* (_optional_) You find a lot of examples and code here from [Pedro](https://github.com/Pedro-Pessoa/). THX at this point goes to Pedro I learned a lot from you! üëç

### What you need to change based on your own profile/needs
* Username
* Database names
* Role-/User-IDs
* Channel IDs
* Links to specific profiles/websites
* You can choose to copy the comments `{{/*This is a comment*/}}` or not, I see no problem to keep them in the CC (unless you hit the character limit).
